# Launchpad-MIDI-ALURA

### The Launchpad MIDI ALURA is a project made by me together with the ALURA platform, using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, that simulates a dj sound system used by music producers.

* However, different that music producers uses, this application make sounds that is very famous in Brazil, specifically on SBT, that is a television channel.
